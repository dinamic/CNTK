testCases:
  CNTK Run must be completed:
    patterns:
      - __COMPLETED__

  Must train epochs in exactly same order and parameters:
    patterns:
      - Starting Epoch {{integer}}
      - learning rate per sample = {{float}}
      - momentum = {{float}}

  Epochs (with low train loss) must be finished with expected results:
    patterns:
      - Finished Epoch[{{integer}} of {{integer}}]
      - TrainLossPerSample = 0.0
      - TrainLossPerSample = {{float,tolerance=0.05}}
      - EvalErrPerSample = {{float,tolerance=0.005}}
      - AvgLearningRatePerSample = {{float,tolerance=0.1%}}

  Per-minibatch (with low train loss) training results must match:
    patterns:
      - Epoch[{{integer}} of {{integer}}]-Minibatch[{{integer}}-{{integer}}
      - SamplesSeen = {{integer}}
      - TrainLossPerSample =  0.0
      - TrainLossPerSample = {{float,tolerance=0.05}}
      - EvalErr[0]PerSample = {{float,tolerance=0.005}}
